## First Post

Well, after much experimentation with several options I have finally settled on a blog platform that is satisfying all my criteria. Basically, I wanted something that:

* I could have full control of the template
* The blog posts were in a simple format
* Blog posts were under some form of source control
* Could be hosted anywhere
* Had an easy development cycle

The result is this blog site which I think ticks the above boxes without much compromise. 

I shall post again with the technical details.
